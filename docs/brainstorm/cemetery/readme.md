Freeze reazons.

Translator
==========

It was idea to make web interface, to allow regular users help with translations.
Check mockups for [phrases](http://nodeca.github.com/nodeca-design/translator-phrases.html)
& [main](http://nodeca.github.com/nodeca-design/translator-main.html) pages.

Due lack of time we have frozen this project. Now we keep phrases in yaml, and those files
can be edited online via github. That's enogth for development now. May be we resurrect
translator later... sometime...
