Themes
======

Themes is additional layer over templates (views) and assets, suited to
conveniently operate with website look. Here are most often use cases:

- You make different skins for desktop, mobile and tablet devices
- You add 3rd-party component, that extends pages with new elements
- You like to customize default look (e.g. recolor with CSS, change logo)

(!) Themes layer does NOT depend on template engines. It's used for easy
morphing of existing theme elements:

- templates override / add / patch
- binaries add / override (useful for images, smiles)
- CLI tool to test consistency


Theme files
===========

Each theme consist of directories with templates (views), static files
(js/css/images) and config. In nodeca, we use the following structure:

```
.
├─ assets/
│   └─ theme-<id>/*.* 
├─ views/
│   └─ theme-<id>/*.* 
└─ config/themes/<id>.yml
```

1. Some directories can be missed. For example, in inherited themes.
2. Theme can also add other files, those will not be used in inheritance rules.
3. Files structure are nodeca-specific. Themer module is more generic: it just
   care about inheritance & patching of directory trees.


Theme config
============

``` yaml
---
  # Use `inherits` or `extends` if theme is based on another one.
  # `inrerits` creates a new theme, `extends` modifies existing.
  # When both absent, than means that it's a root theme with complete file set.
  
  # inherits: parent_id
  # extends: parent_id

  name:  Mobile Theme       # Full name of theme. Don't mix up with theme id.

  ignore: /.*(txt|md)$/i    # Exclude those files (regex), prior to build theme.
                            # Can be useful, to skip readme and other
                            # description files.
```

Theme id is taken from config file name (without extension).


Patches & overrides
===================

Override happens, when file with the same name & the same subfolder, as in
parent, found. Subfolders are relative to base prefix (see directives
`templates`, `static` in config).

If you wish to apply patch - make file with appropriate name & location, but add
`.patch` extentions. For example `./views/theme-mobile/forum/index.jade.patch`.
If template needs sevaral patches, ordered by priorities, add weigth prior to
extention, like `./views/theme-mobile/forum/index.jade.45.patch`. Default weight
is 10.

Note, that patch weights are global.

Patches should be `unified diffs`, applyed with `patch` command. There only
exclution is, when we need just add data to the start or to the end of template.
Then create file with extention `.before` or `.after`.

Unsorted
========

Use this info to create better logs or debug tools.

### Detected errors

- duplicated template filenames (from different folders)
- can't add new template in inherited skin
- try to modify not existing file
- failed to apply patch
- no permissions
- patch error (file not found or apply error)

### Statistics

total:

- templates
- files
- build time

for each skin:

- description + dependencies (if other skins extend it)
- total templates
- total files
- list of modified files
  - source
  - who overrides (list of skins)
- list of added files
  - source
  - who added
