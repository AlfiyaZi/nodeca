API Tree
========

Most resources are mapped to API Tree structure `nodeca`. It can be different
on server and client. Also, some methods are specially converted to transparent
remote calls.

Full structure:

```
nodeca

  # main core :) . server & client

  client                  # client methods
  server                  # server methods (on client - async mappers)
  shared                  # available on both client & server,
                          # mostly for helpers

  # server only

  permissions             # access rules
  filters                 # hooks for server methods (mostly to attach access rules)
  settings                # settings accessor (get/set, not tree)
  config                  # parsed config file.
  logger                  # logger instance (winston on server)

  # server & client, dynamic data

  runtime                 # `dynamic` structures
    version               # "1.0.0"
    assets_root           # Root URL for assets `//nodeca.com/assets/`
    bundle                # info about namespaces from static builder
    router                # router instance, filled with routes from config

    debug                 # client flag, to show more info
    language              # client language
```

Collection of CRCs for loadable resources.  It helps to properly cache
static data in local store, and refresh those on server upgrade.
